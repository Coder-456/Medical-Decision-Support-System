A medical decision support system to detect COVID-19 Pneumonia using CNN.

## Abstract
Due to the pandemic by the spread of the COVID virus, there has been a mandatory demand to screen patients. Predominantly RTPCR test is used to detect the virus. The RTPCR test is the most commonly used technique to detect COVID – 19 viruses. The test takes a minimum of 12 hours which is time-consuming and might put a patient's life at stake. This detection method for COVID screening is said to have a false detection rate. 

CT scans have been used for COVID-19 screening and using CT has several challenges especially since their radiation dose is considerably higher than x-rays. Hence, CXRs are a better choice for the initial assessment. Detection of COVID-19 pneumonia is a fine-grained problem as doctors cannot detect it just by looking at the x-ray images. Moreover, the radiologists visit many patients every day and the diagnosis process take signiﬁcant time, which may increase errors in screening notably. 

Therefore, a medical decision support system for screening COVID-19 patients is of utmost importance. This work is a web application that helps to screen COVID-19 patients effectively with the help of CNN.

## Working

Web application is deployed using ngrok for public access using a URL.

The web app prompts the user to upload a Chest X-ray image of the patient who is to be detected to be COVID-19 positive or negative. 

On uploading the image, the image undergoes forward pass through the trained Convolutional Neural Network and the CNN outputs if the patient is COVID-19 positive or negative.
